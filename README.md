# Reinforcement Learning Temperature Adjustment 
Reinforcement Learning Project for making a custom environment for temperature adjustment of a water shower system

PPO algorithm is used for this project. There are two saved models in this repository. One with 40k timesteps and one with 200k timesteps. 

40K Timesteps Learning gave a reward mean of 59.0 and a standard deviation of 1.0
200K Timesteps Learning gave a reward mean of 59.8 and a standard deviation of 0.6
